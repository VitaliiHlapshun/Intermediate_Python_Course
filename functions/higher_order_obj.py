"""
In Python, all functions, including the ones weâ€™ve written, are classified as
first-class objects (sometimes also called first-class citizens or first-class
 functions). This means they have four important characteristics:

First-class objects can be stored as variables. First-class objects can be
passed as arguments to a function. First-class objects can be returned by a
function. First-class objects can be stored in data structures (e.g.,
lists, dictionaries, etc.). """
